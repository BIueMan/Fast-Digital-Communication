# Fast-Digital-Communication
This is a Fast Digital Communication code, that was implementated from zero in under Bachelor Project.

the code includes everything, from the:
* encoder, IQ and pulse shaping of the Transmitter.
* the channel implementation, that noise for both background noise and jitter noise.
* and the reciver, that received the signal, use zero crossing inorder to find the sample rate, Demapper and EVM Calc, and decoder.

as we say befor, all the code was implemented from scratch. incloding the the signal analysis tools like:
*  eye-pattern modulation.
*  constelation diagram.
*  corelation grath

we implemented both M-PSK and QAM techniques for the transmission of data.
